# **App Name**: Cosmic Explorer

## Core Features:

- Interactive 3D Galaxy: Display a WebGL 3D galaxy with dynamic starfield and nebula animations.
- User-Controlled Navigation: Allow users to zoom, pan, and rotate the camera for free cosmic exploration.
- Galaxy Formation Generation: A 'generate' button will initialize a new galaxy formation, based on various cosmic properties to add variety.
- Preset Perspectives: Enable users to switch between preset viewing perspectives (e.g., side view, top view).

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep space theme with dark purple (#1A237E).
- Primary color: Dark blue (#303F9F), evocative of the depths of space, allowing stars and other points of interest to stand out against the background.
- Accent color: Shimmering pink (#F06292), to call attention to areas of the interface without distracting from the beauty of the generated cosmic objects.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' for headlines and 'Inter' for body text; both sans-serif, creating a futuristic and readable interface.
- Use simple, glowing icons for navigation and controls.
- Minimalist UI with controls overlaying the 3D galaxy view.
- Subtle animations for starfield and nebula movement to enhance immersion.
